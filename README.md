# PAYNE4MIKE
This is an adaptation from Yuan-Sen Ting's original The Payne model. I changed the architecture of the model used in the original The Payne. The goal was to test it across a range of model architectures and see how well the validation loss improved as we added layers and neurons per layer.

To run this code, clone this repository, and run "two_layers_training.ipynb"

There exist files for more layers, but I chose this one since it was the most cleaned up code.
